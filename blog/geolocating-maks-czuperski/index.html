          <h2>Geolocating Maks Czuperski</h2>
          <p>Posted January 18, 2017</p>
        </header>

        <p>The other day while checking my Twitter feed, I came across an interesting
retweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins">Elliot Higgins</a>, the
founder of <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/">Bellingcat</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalSherlocks?src=hash">#DigitalSherlocks</a> out there!—Where am I? <a href="https://t.co/4eXw7BuMj8">pic.twitter.com/4eXw7BuMj8</a></p>&mdash; Maks Czuperski (@MaksCzuperski) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaksCzuperski/status/819510013148463105">January 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This looked like a fun challenge and being the OSINT geek that I am, I
couldn't let it pass. Here is how I geolocated Maks Czuperski:</p>

<p>First thing was of course to get a copy of the image. Right-click and
<em>Copy Image Address</em> gave me a good 2048x1536px version where details
could be picked out.</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation/whereami.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/geolocation/whereami_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>The picture from Maks Czuperski's tweet.</h3>
</article>

<p>The location did not look familiar to me and there were no famous buildings in
the background, readable street signs or other easy wins to quickly figure out
the location. The building across the plaza did have a kind of interesting shape
and colors, so the first thing I tried was to cut out a piece of the picture with
part of the building clearly visible without obstructions, and upload it to
Google's reverse image search. It is quite impressive, and almost eerie, what
Google can recognize in images. This time however, I had no luck. I also tried
with a crop of the walkway pattern in the lower area of the picture, but no luck
there either.</p>

<p>Next step was to zoom in on the image and comb it for any details that could
give me a hint to its location. This was when I spotted the store signs in the
lower right corner of the image:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation/whereami_zoom.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/geolocation/whereami_zoom_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>An Expert store is visible in the image.</h3>
</article>

<p>I was lucky to know that Expert is an electronics store from my time living
in Denmark and, assuming that Expert only has stores in Denmark, I wondered if it
could be somewhere in Copenhagen perhaps. A quick Google search led me to the
company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_(company)">Wikipedia article</a>
which stated that Expert operates in several countries a part from Denmark:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Norway</li>
    <li>Denmark</li>
    <li>Sweden</li>
    <li>Faroe Islands</li>
    <li>Åland Islands</li>
    <li>Finland</li>
    <li>Estonia</li>
    <li>Belgium</li>
    <li>Germany</li>
    <li>Greece</li>
    <li>Ireland</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>Austria</li>
    <li>Czech Republic</li>
    <li>Iceland</li>
    <li>Italy</li>
    <li>The Netherlands</li>
    <li>Portugal</li>
    <li>Spain</li>
    <li>Slovakia</li>
    <li>Australia/New Zealand</li>
    <li>Croatia</li>
    <li>Hungary</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>This made the list of potential places quite a bit bigger, but at least it
was narrowed down to a handful of countries. I combed through the picture once
more to find any other details I could pair with this information and pretty
quickly spotted a sign for a place called "Gold Mountain" right next to the
Expert shop:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation/whereami_gold_mountain.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/geolocation/whereami_gold_mountain_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>A place called Gold Mountain next to Expert.</h3>
</article>

<p>I had never heard of Gold Mountain before, and it was my hope that
this would be a bit more unique than Expert. I made the assumption that he was
most likely in a capital city, or at least a bigger city, in one of the countries
where Expert operates. My plan was now to perform a search for <em>Gold Mountain</em>
combined with the capital city name for each country in the list:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation/google_gold_mountain.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="/images/geolocation/google_gold_mountain_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>Googling for <em>Gold Mountain</em> in Oslo.</h3>
</article>

<p>Bingo! I was lucky that the capital for the first country in the list yielded
a result that looked like the right place. The Google Streetview image to the
right of the search results looked like it had the funnily shaped building in
the background, and sure enough, clicking on it <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x46416e87584d4a15:0xec11d10f5cae7d6c!2m19!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m13!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!3m1!7e115!4s/maps/place/%2522golden%2Bmountain%2522%2Boslo/@59.9130538,10.7342323,3a,75y,315.79h,90t/data%3D*213m4*211e1*213m2*211sg-lA7LDc3hCsqgBfS2QtPQ*212e0*214m2*213m1*211s0x0:0xec11d10f5cae7d6c?hl%3Den!5s%22golden+mountain%22+oslo+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e2!2sg-lA7LDc3hCsqgBfS2QtPQ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzu6bc8MvRAhXGAxoKHTyXDIUQpx8IbjAK">landed me</a> straight on the  plaza in the picture!</p>

<p>I pretty quickly determined the direction that the picture was taken from and
tweeted at Maks Czuperski:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaksCzuperski">@MaksCzuperski</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins">@EliotHiggins</a> Somewhere here? <a href="https://t.co/FplgM8BPop">pic.twitter.com/FplgM8BPop</a></p>&mdash; Michael Henriksen (@michenriksen) <a href="https://twitter.com/michenriksen/status/819517437259476992">January 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After a while he replied and asked me to be more precise. I tried to narrow
it down further:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaksCzuperski">@MaksCzuperski</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins">@EliotHiggins</a> My guess would be one of these top windows. It&#39;s Fridtjof Nansens Plass in Oslo. <a href="https://t.co/y1TmuzmoyU">pic.twitter.com/y1TmuzmoyU</a></p>&mdash; Michael Henriksen (@michenriksen) <a href="https://twitter.com/michenriksen/status/819527342745878528">January 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I managed to narrow it down to a couple of windows where the picture could
have been taken from, which I think was pretty cool. It was a super fun exercise
and I wish someone would arrange daily or weekly geolocation challenges like this!</p>

<p>If you find this sort of stuff interesting, you should definitely check out
<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/">Bellingcat</a>'s articles and guides. In
case you haven't heard of them, here's a short description of what they are about,
from their own website:</p>

<blockquote>
Bellingcat uses open source and social media investigation to investigate a variety of subjects, from Mexican drug lords to conflicts being fought across the world. Bellingcat brings together contributors who specialise in open source and social media investigation, and creates guides and case studies so others may learn to do the same.
</blockquote>

<p>As a little bonus to my investigation, I later came across the following tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaksCzuperski">@MaksCzuperski</a> for more insight on social media and the engagement age. <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlantkomite">@Atlantkomite</a> <a href="https://t.co/9eTyvf0NSN">pic.twitter.com/9eTyvf0NSN</a></p>&mdash; Marita I. Wangberg (@FD_Marita) <a href="https://twitter.com/FD_Marita/status/819497169413607424">January 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The picture shows Maks Czuperski doing a presentation on geolocation stuff
at the Norwegian Atlantic Committee. He apparently used his geolocation challenge
tweet as part of his presentation, to demonstrate how quickly someone could find
him. Pretty cool!</p>
