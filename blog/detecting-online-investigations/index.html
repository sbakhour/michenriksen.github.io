          <h2>Detecting online investigations</h2>
          <p>Posted November 14, 2016</p>
        </header>

        <p>I recently purchased a license for <a href="https://www.hunch.ly/">Hunchly</a>,
an awesome tool for performing online investigations and general research on
the web. The tool seems to be very popular among criminal investigators,
journalists and OSINT geeks like me.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, Hunchly is a tool that integrates directly into your
browser through an extension to record and store local copies of every website
you visit during an investigation. This is very convenient when doing OSINT
investigations as you never loose anything, even if it gets deleted at a later
time, and it makes it easy to trace your steps to how you found a particular
piece of information.</p>

<p>Another great feature of Hunchly is the ability to associate so-called <em>selectors</em>
 to cases. Selectors are basically specific strings of interest that Hunchly will
 then keep track of, and notify you whenever these selectors are found on
 websites you visit. Selectors would normally be things like names, email
 addresses, phone numbers, domains and anything else that is relevant to the
 person or subject you are investigating.</p>

 <p>Hunchly can be configured to automatically highlight these selectors on
 websites when they are encountered. It is not enabled by default, but I'm sure
 it's a very common setting to enable as it makes it very easy to spot the
 relevant parts when browsing:</p>

  <h3>Highlighted selectors on the michenriksen.com frontpage.</h3>
</article>

<p>The above screenshot shows how my website's frontpage looks like when Hunchly
is configured with the selectors: <em>Michael Henriksen</em>, <em>SoundCloud</em>
and <em>Gitrob</em>. All occurrences of these strings are highlighted with a
yellow background.</p>

<p>Since Hunchly is highlighting the selectors by modifying the HTML before it's
displayed in the browser, I started thinking about how a tech-savvy criminal,
or anyone doing activities that would cause people to investigate them, such as
an activist, could exploit this feature to detect the fact that someone is
actively investigating them, and even get a sense of what the investigator knows
and what they are interested in.</p>

<p>This is how Hunchly highlights selector strings:</p>

<pre>
&lt;mark data-markjs=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;hunchly&quot;&gt;selector text&lt;/mark&gt;
</pre>

<p>Hunchly wraps the selectors in <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> tags with a unique
class of <code>hunchly</code> which can be used to very accurately determine
that Hunchly is being used on a website.</p>

<p>Using a bit of Javascript, it is fairly easy for anyone worried about being
investigated to detect it. Here is a small Proof Of Concept:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/michenriksen/3ace5b2714097d05ea18bc843b1719ad.js"></script>

<p>On <strong>line 9 - 11</strong> a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is defined
with an ID of <code>canary</code>. This element would contain potential
selectors that an investigator is likely to have entered into Hunchly. This
should obviously not contain actual sensitive information that would help an
investigator, but already publicly known information such as a name, public
email address, etc. which is very likely for an investigator to have entered
into Hunchly. It could also contain misinformation (e.g. a fake phone number)
that has been planted on other websites. This would give the person under
investigation an idea of where the investigator has already been, and what the
investigator thinks they know about their target.</p>

<p>On <strong>line 14</strong> the Javascript is looking for any
<code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> tags with a <code>hunchly</code> class within the
<code>#canary</code> div element. If no elements are found, it simply logs
<em>No Hunchly selectors found in canary</em> to the console.</p>

<p><strong>Line 18 - 22</strong> is what is being executed if a Hunchly selector
highlight is found within the <code>#canary</code> element. It logs the total
amount of selectors detected and then loops over each selector to log the text
that was highlighted. It finishes off with popping up an alert box with
<em>Hi there, investigator!</em> as the message.</p>

<p>Instead of simply logging the information to the console, the script could
easily be modified to call out to a backend script with Ajax or do something
more aggressive like triggering a browser exploit, loading a <a href="http://beefproject.com/">BeEF</a>
hook, redirecting them to Goatse or anything else to mess with the investigator.
I'm sure you can come up with other fun things to do...</p>

<p>Before I finish this post, I want emphasize that this is not meant as a diss
to Hunchly, I think it's an excellent tool and would recommend it to anyone
doing OSINT stuff. I simply felt like pointing out a potential problem with
Hunchly's selector highlight feature, so if you are looking into someone who
might be crazy enough to do stuff like this, you might want to turn that feature
off. I don't know if this is the reason it is disabled as default, or if there
is another reason. Anyways, check out <a href="https://www.hunch.ly">Hunchly</a>
website or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA1ec0dPYhw">excellent video tutorial</a>
if you want to know more about the tool.</p>
