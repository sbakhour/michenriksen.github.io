          <h2>Geolocating Miriam Steimer</h2>
          <p>Posted June 18, 2017</p>
        </header>

        <p>If you have been following my blog, you might know that one of my weird
  hobbies is to determine the location of where pictures were taken. My previous
  post on <a href="/blog/geolocating-maks-czuperski/">Geolocating Maks Czuperski</a>
  caught quite a lot of buzz, so I thought I would write up how I solved
  another recent geolocation challenge, as it seems like you don't necessarily
  need to catch the <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/10/08/mh17-the-open-source-evidence/">Russian Ministry of Defense lying</a>
  about passenger planes being shot out of the sky for people to be interested in
  this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>It all started when I saw a Retweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/869518189738299394">Christiaan Triebert</a>
  on my Twitter feed:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc">@trbrtc</a> where are we? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/geolocation?src=hash">#geolocation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/itsagame?src=hash">#itsagame</a> <a href="https://t.co/g8JDCgw9Af">pic.twitter.com/g8JDCgw9Af</a></p>&mdash; miriam steimer (@miriamsteimer) <a href="https://twitter.com/miriamsteimer/status/869506933933387777">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/miriamsteimer">Miriam Steimer</a>
  seemed to challenge Christiaan Triebert to find out where they were to come
  join them for lunch. It didn't exactly look like a challenge meant for everyone
  but I couldn't ignore it, and so I decided to give it a go...</p>

<p>Right-clicking on the image and <em>Copy Image Address</em> gave me a pretty
  high resolution version of the image where I could pick out details easier.</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>The picture from Miriam Steimer's tweet.</h3>
</article>

<p>My first idea was to comb the picture for any <em>easy-wins</em> such as the
  name of the place on the yellow parasols in the background, the napkins on the
  table or perhaps on the cutlery or plates, but no luck there. It did make me
  a bit hungry though...</p>

<p>One detail that I noticed was something that looked like a typical employee
  badge hidden under the phone on the middle table:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe_zoom_badge.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe_zoom_badge_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>A possible employee badge under the phone.</h3>
</article>

<p>The badge made me think that maybe they were having lunch at a work cafeteria
  or similar, so time to figure out where Miriam works...</p>

<p>Figuring out where she works was pretty straight-forward as her Twitter profile
  bio says she is a journalist working for <a href="https://www.zdf.de/">ZDF</a>
  and that she is located in Mainz, Germany.</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/miriam_steimer_profile.png" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/miriam_steimer_profile.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>Miriam's Twitter profile.</h3>
</article>

<p>With a bit of Googling, I learned that ZDF has a big broadcasting center in
  Mainz with pretty interesting architecture:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/maps_zdf_sendezentrum.png" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/maps_zdf_sendezentrum_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>Google Maps view of the <em>ZDF Sendezentrum</em> in Mainz.</h3>
</article>

<p>I went back to the picture from Miriam's tweet to see if I could find
  anything that I could use to confirm that the picture was taken somewhere at
  the ZDF broadcasting center. After a bit of staring, I noticed that a building
  facade with something that looks like shiny metallic plates is visible in the
  background. This could be useful for determining the location more precisely.</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe_background.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/wherearewe_background_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>A building facade in the background.</h3>
</article>

<p>Scrolling through the Google Image search results for <em>ZDF sendezentrum</em>
  made me come across a <a href="http://www.jobundfit.de/uploads/pics/Cafeteria_SZ_1_Ausgabelinie.jpg">picture</a>
  of something that looked very much like a cafeteria:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/casino_cafeteria.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/casino_cafeteria.jpg" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>Casino Cafeteria.</h3>
</article>

<p>The picture was found on a <a href="http://www.jobundfit.de/qualitaetsstandard/zertifizierung/praxispaten/zdf-casino-mainz.html">web page</a>
  about <em>ZDF-Casino GmbH</em> catering company getting the
  <em>JOB &amp; Fit</em> certification. Doing another Google Image search for
  <em>ZDF sendezentrum casino</em> I came across another valuable
  <a href="http://www.stepmap.de/landkarte/sendezentrum-zdf-1267042.png">image</a>:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/sendezentrum_map.png" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/sendezentrum_map_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>A map of the ZDF Sendezentrum with the Casino building.</h3>
</article>

<p>Knowing that the name of the ZDF cafeteria is called Casino and having a map
  of the area was good and all, but I still needed to find a building with the
  facade that is visible in the picture. I scrolled through some more Google
  Image search results and came across another <a href="http://realschule-plus-langenlonsheim.com/s/cc_images/cache_2477728153.JPG">picture</a>
  that caught my attention:</p>

<article class="6u 12u$(xsmall) poptrox center">
  <a href="/images/geolocation2/sendezentrum_entrance.jpg" class="image fit thumb">
  <img src="/images/geolocation2/sendezentrum_entrance_thumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
  <h3>Entrance to the ZDF Sendezentrum with directions and an interesting building in the background.</h3>
</article>

<p>The picture showed what looks like the entrance to the ZDF Sendezentrum with
  directions to the <em>Kasinogebäude</em> and more importantly, a building in
  the background with what looks like the same kind of shiny metallic plates.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick tweet to Miriam and Christiaan to figure out if I was going
  in the right direction:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, random twitterer here, looks like it could be somewhere near the &quot;Kasinogebäude&quot;?</p>&mdash; Michael Henriksen (@michenriksen) <a href="https://twitter.com/michenriksen/status/869559591419478016">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After a while, Christiaan replied:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Correct! Should not be hard to find the exact location now — good luck ;-)</p>&mdash; Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) <a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/869563326073888768">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Perfect! I used the map picture I found earlier to align my Google Maps view
  and tweeted my guess:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Somewhere in the red square, perhaps? <a href="https://t.co/c3HH84PPbs">pic.twitter.com/c3HH84PPbs</a></p>&mdash; Michael Henriksen (@michenriksen) <a href="https://twitter.com/michenriksen/status/869567449733234690">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Christiaan replied again with their exact location:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nice, very close, just a few more meters northward! <a href="https://t.co/qo9zk86IAH">pic.twitter.com/qo9zk86IAH</a></p>&mdash; Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) <a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/869584650490040320">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>My guess was a bit off as Christiaan's very nice breakdown shows, but I think
  I was close enough to call it a win. The lesson learned was to remember to
  always look at a place from all angles in Google Maps. Had I done that, I
  would have seen the yellow parasols hiding among the trees in the green area.</p>

<p>Christiaan later challenged me with another picture which I also solved,
  but I won't go over how I did it, I will leave it as a challenge for you to
  find out. Maybe you can figure out how I did it. Let me know how you solved it. :)

It is near (1-50km radius) of the other photo, to give a hint. <a href="https://t.co/Kutw2sK6wP">pic.twitter.com/Kutw2sK6wP</a></p>&mdash; Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) <a href="https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/869587705251983361">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>If you enjoyed this post, maybe you are also interested in reading my
  previous post about how I <a href="/blog/geolocating-maks-czuperski/">Geolocated Maks Czuperski</a>.
  If you would like to try out geolocation yourself, I would recommend keeping
  an eye on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23DigitalSherlocks&src=typd">#DigitalSherlocks</a>
  hashtag on Twitter as people often tweet these sorts of challenges using that
  hashtag.</p>
