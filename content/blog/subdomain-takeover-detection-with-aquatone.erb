<p>Hostile subdomain takeover is a very prevalent and potentially critical
security issue. It's a well-known attack vector and easy to exploit, and should
therefore be taken seriously.</p>

<p>A subdomain takeover vulnerability typically happens when an organization
assigns a subdomain to an external service, e.g. a support ticketing system like
<a href="https://zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, a cloud application platform like
<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or maybe a content delivery network
like <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>. Maybe the organization is
only assessing the service, or maybe they switch to a different service, but for
some reason the organization later decides to delete their account on the
service, but forget one important step: to remove the subdomain DNS
configuration to the service.</p>

<p>Having a dangling subdomain pointing to an unused external service leaves it
open for takeover and complete control of an attacker, as they simply need to
sign up to the same service and claim the dangling subdomain. Now they control
the content on the subdomain which they can use to launch phishing attacks,
bypass security controls and other mischief.</p>

about subdomain takeover back in 2014, if you're interested in knowing more
about this attack vector.</p>

<h2>Detecting subdomain takeovers with AQUATONE</h2>

<p>In case you don't know, I recently released <a href="/blog/aquatone-tool-for-domain-flyovers/">AQUATONE</a>
which is a toolset for doing subdomain discovery, port scanning and
screenshotting. Check out the <a href="/blog/aquatone-tool-for-domain-flyovers/">blog post</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>A new addition to the AQUATONE toolset is <code>aquatone-takeover</code>
which can detect potential subdomain takeover issues across a bunch of popular
external services:</p>

  <h3>Finding subdomains vulnerable to hostile takeover.</h3>
</article>

<p>To demonstrate the functionality of aquatone-takeover, I temporarily
configured a couple of subdomains on <code>michenriksen.com</code> pointed at 3
different external services. aquatone-takeover detects all three as potentially
vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>assets.michenriksen.com</code> is a <code>CNAME</code> record
    pointing to an unclaimed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
    bucket.</li>
  <li><code>store.michenriksen.com</code> is a <code>CNAME</code> record
    pointing to <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, a popular
    ecommerce platform, and the subdomain has not been registered with any
    account.</li>
  <li>Finally, <code>help.michenriksen.com</code> is a <code>CNAME</code> record
    pointing at a non-existant account on <a href="https://www.desk.com/">Desk</a>,
    a popular support ticketing system.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not the only external services that aquatone-takeover can detect,
it finds subdomain takeover vulnerabilities across - at the time of writing -
a total of 25 services:</p>
