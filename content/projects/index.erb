<h3><a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob">Gitrob</a> <small>Reconnaissance tool for GitHub organizations</small></h3>
<p>Gitrob is a command line tool which can help
organizations and security professionals find sensitive information lingering in
publicly available files on GitHub. The tool will iterate over all public
organization and member repositories and match filenames against a range of
patterns for files that typically contain sensitive or dangerous information.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/easywins">Easywins</a> <small>Probe a website for sensitive endpoints</small></h3>
<p>Easywins is a command line tool that can quickly check a website for common
endpoints that can be used to gain a foothold or gather information. The list of
endpoints is taken from Rob Fuller's <a href="https://github.com/pwnwiki/webappurls">PWN Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/hibp">HIBP</a> <small>Check e-mail addresses against the haveibeenpwned.com API</small></h3>
<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> is a fantastic and
free web service to check if an e-mail address is included in a collection of
high profile data breaches. HIBP is a simple command line tool to check a bunch
of addresses against the HaveIBeenPwned.com API.</p>

<h3><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dolus/">Dolus</a> <small>Spread disinformation when you browse with fake proxy server information</small></h3>
<p>Dolus is a simple Add-on for the Firefox browser that will add a X-Forwarded-For
header with a fake IP address to all the browser's requests. The X-Forwarded-For
header is used by transparent proxies to tell servers which IP address they are
forwarding requests for and because of that, many servers will log that IP instead
of the actual requesting IP address. The Add-on can give some potential extra
anonymity, but it is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2014-edition-140315/">VPN</a> or anonymity software like <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a>!</p>

<h3><a href="https://diceware.herokuapp.com/">Diceware Passphrase Generator</a> <small>Secure Diceware passphrase generator</small></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a> is a method for
creating secure passphrases. The normal procedure requires several rolls with a
die which can be pretty time consuming, but the Diceware Passphrase Generator
simulates this procedure in code to make it much faster. The passphrase generation
is done with client-side Javascript, so no passphrase is ever transfered over the
wires, and the Javascript code is delivered over TLS/SSL which provides reasonable
protection against tampering.</p>

<h3><a href="https://hackpad.herokuapp.com/">HackPad</a> <small>Useful tools and functions for web application security assessments</small></h3>
<p>HackPad is a web application hacker's toolbox. It is meant as a central place
to access all the common encoding and decoding functions that are often used when
doing a security assessment on a web application. All functions are implemented
in client-side Javascript, so there is no risk of leaking sensitive data.</p>
