<p>I'm Michael, an engineer and overall geek living in Berlin, Germany. I'm currently working in the Trust, Safety &amp; Security team at <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<p>Coding, information security and online privacy are my main interests, so those will mostly be the topics of my blog posts.</p>
